- `shopify-buy` - Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK
- `@shopify/hydrogen-react` - Shopify's React utilities
- `react-router-dom` - Client-side routing
- `@types/shopify-buy` - TypeScript types

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Shopify Store

1. Create a Shopify store (or use existing)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Apps and sales channels** → **Develop apps**
3. Create a custom app with Storefront API access
4. Copy your **Storefront API access token**

See [SHOPIFY_SETUP.md](./SHOPIFY_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
   VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

### Step 3: Add Products to Shopify

1. In Shopify Admin, go to **Products**
2. Add products with:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Images
   - Price
   - Variants (sizes, colors, etc.)
   - Tags (add "new" for featured items)

### Step 4: Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit:
- `http://localhost:5173/` - Home page
- `http://localhost:5173/shop` - Browse all products
- Click any product to see details
- Add items to cart
- Click cart icon to view/checkout

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Data Flow:

1. **Product Loading**:
   - `ShopifyService.getAllProducts()` fetches products from Shopify
   - Products are transformed to our TypeScript types
   - `ShopPage` displays products in a grid
   - `ProductCard` shows individual items with quick add

2. **Product Details**:
   - URL parameter gets product handle
   - `ShopifyService.getProductByHandle()` fetches details
   - Variant selection updates displayed price/availability
   - Add to cart button adds to context

3. **Cart Management**:
   - `CartContext` manages cart state
   - Cart data stored in localStorage
   - Shopify checkout created on first add
   - Updates synced to Shopify
   - Checkout button redirects to Shopify

### State Management:

```
CartProvider (Context)
├── cart (array of items)
├── checkoutUrl (Shopify checkout URL)
├── addToCart()
├── removeFromCart()
├── updateQuantity()
└── clearCart()
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Product Display:
Edit `src/pages/ShopPage.tsx`:
- Grid layout
- Filtering logic
- Loading states
- Error handling

### Product Details:
Edit `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx`:
- Layout and spacing
- Image gallery behavior
- Variant selection UI
- Product info sections

### Cart:
Edit `src/components/Cart.tsx`:
- Sidebar styling
- Item display
- Checkout button
- Empty state

### Styling:
All components use Tailwind CSS with dark/light mode support. Colors adapt to the `isDark` theme prop.

## 💡 Key Features

- Availability status updates in real-time
- Out of stock items are clearly marked

### Variant Management:

- Dynamic option buttons (size, color, etc.)
- Automatic variant matching
- Per-variant pricing and images

### Persistent Cart:
- Cart saved to localStorage
- Survives page refreshes
- Synced with Shopify checkout
- Clean up on checkout completion

### Performance:
- Products loaded once and cached
- Lazy loading for product images
- Efficient state updates
- Minimal API calls

## 🔒 Security

## 📱 Shopify POS Integration

This implementation is compatible with Shopify POS:

1. **Inventory Sync**: 
   - Stock levels sync between online and POS
   - Real-time updates

2. **Product Catalog**: 
   - Same products available in both
   - Consistent pricing and variants

3. **Order Management**: 
   - All orders viewable in Shopify Admin
   - Unified reporting

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Variables:
Make sure to set these in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`
- `VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The app will work with your existing Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## 📊 Next Steps

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Product search bar
   - Filter by price, tags, etc.

2. **Customer Accounts**
   - Login/logout
   - Order history
